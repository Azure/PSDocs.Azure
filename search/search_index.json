Ready to go # PSDocs for Azure automatically generates documentation for Azure infrastructure as code (IaC) artifacts. It does this by, reading then processing each artifacts with one or more included documentation templates. Documentation is outputted as markdown a standard, easy to read, easy to render format for modern documentation. We use the same standard for docs.microsoft.com . Currently the following infrastructure code artifacts are supported: Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template files. Example output . As new features are added and improved, download the latest PowerShell module to start using them. DevOps # Azure infrastructure code such as ARM template supports a number of ways to self document in code. PSDocs uses these existing features and makes them easier to consume.

Cross-platform # PSDocs uses modern PowerShell libraries at its core, allowing it to go anywhere PowerShell can go. PSDocs runs on MacOS, Linux and Windows. PowerShell makes it easy to integrate PSDocs into popular CI systems. To install, use the Install-Module cmdlet within PowerShell. For installation options see install instructions . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) # Can PSDocs read from metadata.json? # The Azure Quickstart Templates repository uses an additional metadata.json to store template metadata. PSDocs doesn't require a metadata.json file to exist but will fallback to this file if it exists. For details on metadata.json see Azure Resource Manager QuickStart Templates contributing guide . PSDocs reads metadata.json using the following logic: Metadata is loaded from the template metadata property. When metadata.json exists, properties are merged with the template metadata. Properties included in template metadata override properties included from metadata.json . The $schema property from metadata.json is ignored. For PSDocs to discover metadata.json it must exist in the same directory as the template file. When creating metadata.json use only lowercase in the file name. The schema of metadata.json differs from template metadata. To maintain compatibility, PSDocs automatically maps the metadata as described in the following table. metadata.json Template metadata Description itemDisplayName Maps to name Used for markdown page title. summary Maps to summary Used as a short description for the markdown page. description Maps to description Used as a detailed description for the markdown page. For example: If name exists in template metadata, this will take priority over itemDisplayName from metadata.json . If name does not exist in template metadata, itemDisplayName from metadata.json will be used. How do I include a badge image? # To include a badge image, create the .ps-docs/azure-template-badges.md file. Within this file add markdown links to your badge image. Use the following placeholders to reference unique images per template. {{ template_path }} - The relative path of the template directory. {{ template_path_encoded }} - The relative path of the template directory URL encoded.

LONG DESCRIPTION # PSDocs allows external files to be included in Azure template documentation. Commonly this concept is used to include images that represent the validation status of the template. These images, are commonly referred to as badges . PSDocs can include badges that have been generated by an external validation tool. To include badge markdown: Create a sub-directory called .ps-docs in the working path of PSDocs. This would normally be root directory ( $PWD ) of the repository where your Azure template are stored. Create a file named azure-template-badges.md within the .ps-docs sub-directory. When creating all files and folder use lower case names. The contents of this file is automatically inserted in generated output after the title but before description. Include badges # To include badge images use standard markdown syntax within the azure-template-badges.md file. Markdown uses links to reference images. A person viewing the page must have permissions to view the source image. If not, the badge may be shown as a broken or placeholder image. For example: ![ label ]( https://image_uri ) For example, a Github Actions badge for PSDocs.Azure would be: ![ Analyze ]( https://github.com/Azure/PSDocs.Azure/workflows/Analyze/badge.svg ) To include badges images with a clickable link use standard markdown syntax: [ ![label ]( https://image_uri )](https://link_uri) For example, an Azure Pipelines badge for PSDocs.Azure would be: [ ![Build Status ]( https://dev.azure.com/PSDocs/PSDocs.Azure/_apis/build/status/PSDocs.Azure-CI?branchName=refs%2Fpull%2F44%2Fmerge )](https://dev.azure.com/PSDocs/PSDocs.Azure/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=refs%2Fpull%2F44%2Fmerge) Dynamic links # In additional to inserting static content, some replacement tokens have been defined.
